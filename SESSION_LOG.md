# RealDeal — Session Log

## Session 1 — 2026-03-31 — Genesis

### What Was Done
- Read and synthesized two comprehensive research reports (ChatGPT deep research)
- Defined tech stack: Turborepo + Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4
- Scaffolded monorepo structure (apps/web, packages/*, services/*, infra/, data/, docs/, kb/)
- Built design system with custom tokens (@theme): brand colors, deal colors, alert colors, trust zone colors, typography scale, spacing grid
- Built core layout: sticky header with navigation + mobile hamburger, footer with link columns and affiliate disclosure
- Built home page: hero section, how-it-works grid, top deals section with DealCard component, category browser, trust explanation with alert signup form
- Built DealCard component with: effective price, face value strikethrough, discount badge, trust badge, deal score, confidence score, region/freshness meta, external link CTA
- Built TrustBadge component (Green/Yellow/Red with shield icons)
- Built DealScore component (gradient pills: Excellent/Good/Fair/Weak)
- Built 7 pages: home, deals, brands, categories, methodology, alerts, about
- All pages have unique title/description metadata and OG tags
- Created governance: CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_RULES.md, PRODUCTION_PLAN.md
- Created KB: PROJECT_BRIEF.md, PRODUCT_VISION.md, ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
- Build passes cleanly: all 7 pages statically rendered, 0 errors, ~102kB First Load JS

### Decisions Made
- Turborepo over Nx (lighter, sufficient for our needs)
- Next.js 15 over Astro (SSR + React ecosystem + Vercel)
- Drizzle ORM planned over Prisma (SQL-first, lighter runtime)
- Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts (clean + tabular numbers for prices)
- Dual scoring system (Deal Quality + Confidence shown separately)
- Green/Yellow/Red trust zones as primary trust UX
- Publisher/referral model only in V1

### Lessons
- Interactive CLI tools (create-turbo, create-next-app) fail in non-TTY environments — manual scaffolding is cleaner and gives more control
- Tailwind CSS 4 @theme syntax works well for design tokens as CSS custom properties

### State
- Build: passes
- Pages: 7/7 rendering
- Design system: defined and applied
- Data: sample/placeholder (6 mock deals, 6 categories, 12 brands)
- Backend: not started (Phase 1)
- Deployment: not started

### Next Session Priorities
1. Initialize git, create GitHub repo, push
2. Set up Notion project management hub
3. Legal pages (terms, privacy, disclosure)
4. SEO foundation (robots.txt, sitemap, JSON-LD)
5. Begin Phase 1: canonical data schemas
